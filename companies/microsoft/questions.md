## Microsoft Frontend Staff Engineer: Common Data Structures & Algorithms Interview Questions

### Overview
For Frontend Staff Engineer positions at Microsoft, you can expect a combination of classic data structures & algorithms (DSA) problems, core JavaScript and frontend-centric coding scenarios, and architectural problem solving. These interviews test both your engineering fundamentals and depth in frontend technologies.

- Review common JavaScript quirks (closures, scope, async/await, polyfills).
- Study React/Vue/Angular patterns and lifecycle methods.
- Practice system design with frontend focus (caching, state management, performance).
- Understand browser internals (rendering, event loop, network requests).
- Discuss and defend your choices, scalability, and trade-offs—systematic thinking is crucial at the staff level[4][5][6][3].
- Practice building mini-applications live during interviews.
