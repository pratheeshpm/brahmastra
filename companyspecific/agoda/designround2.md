Here is a consolidated list of Agoda Frontend IC4 (Senior/Staff/Lead) 2nd round interview questions organized in points:

### System Design & Platform Questions
- How would you design a large-scale web platform for Agoda's accommodation search from scratch? ‚Üí **[üìñ Large-Scale Web Platform Design](./large-scale-web-platform-design.md)**
- Explain the end-to-end flow of a user action (e.g., searching and booking a hotel) and architect the frontend for fast, scalable, and error-resilient UX. ‚Üí **[üìñ End-to-End Flow Architecture](./end-to-end-flow-architecture.md)**
- How would you design the frontend architecture for Agoda's hotel search with 10,000 concurrent users? ‚Üí **[üìñ Frontend Architecture for 10K Concurrent Users](./frontend-architecture-10k-concurrent-users.md)**
- How would you design the architecture for a frontend system that integrates with multiple backend APIs for hotel search and booking? ‚Üí **[üìñ Multi-Backend API Integration Architecture](./multi-backend-api-integration-architecture.md)**
- What real-world challenges might arise if you were to build a scalable micro-frontend architecture at Agoda, and how would you address them? ‚Üí **[üìñ Scalable Micro-Frontend Architecture Challenges](./scalable-micro-frontend-architecture-challenges.md)**
- Compare Monolith vs. Micro-Frontend architectures. What would you choose at Agoda, and why? ‚Üí **[üìñ Frontend Architecture Comparison](./frontend-architecture-comparison.md)**
- Given Agoda's global scale, what strategies would you apply for internationalization and localization in a large single-page web application?
- Explain the difference between server-side and client-side rendering. When would you use each at scale for Agoda's platform?
- If Agoda needed to migrate its legacy AngularJS platform to React, what migration strategy, risks, and best practices would you employ?

### Frontend Key Concepts
- Discuss how you would implement test coverage (unit, integration, E2E) for a new Agoda feature. How do you decide what to test and at which level? Why is coverage important at scale?
- How would you ensure security in a frontend web application? (XSS, CSRF, CORS, secure cookies, session storage, input validation)
- What are common frontend security vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF) and how would you architect Agoda‚Äôs frontend to mitigate them in a multi-tenant environment?
- How would you implement robust error handling and retry logic for critical API calls in a React/TypeScript application serving millions of users?
- Discuss techniques for optimizing large-scale state management (Redux, Context, etc.) when multiple async sources and real-time updates are involved.
- Can you explain the internals of JS Promises and how you‚Äôd use them to manage concurrent API requests efficiently in a highly interactive UI?

### Performance Optimization & Testing
- What techniques can you use to optimize the performance of a React/Angular app at scale? ‚Üí **[üìñ React/Angular Performance Optimization at Scale](./react-angular-performance-optimization-at-scale.md)**
- What tools and techniques would you use to monitor and improve real user performance metrics (e.g., FCP, TTI) for Agoda's mobile web? Describe an end-to-end measurement process. ‚Üí **[üìñ Real User Performance Monitoring for Agoda Mobile](./real-user-performance-monitoring-agoda-mobile.md)**
- How do you approach A/B testing and experimentation in frontend development, especially when running hundreds of experiments simultaneously as Agoda does? ‚Üí **[üìñ A/B Testing and Experimentation at Scale](./ab-testing-experimentation-frontend-agoda.md)**
- What are the key differences between unit tests, integration tests, and E2E tests for a booking widget? When should each be prioritized in Agoda's codebase? ‚Üí **[üìñ Testing Strategies for Booking Widget](./testing-strategies-booking-widget-agoda.md)**
- What strategies would you use to reduce FCP and TTI on Agoda mobile web? ‚Üí **[üìñ FCP and TTI Optimization for Agoda Mobile](./fcp-tti-optimization-agoda-mobile.md)**

### Leadership & Stakeholder Management
- Describe a situation where you led the technical implementation of a major feature. How did you manage stakeholder requirements, technical debt, and team coordination?
- Tell us about a time you took ownership of a technical project‚Äîhow did you measure its success and impact?
- How do you drive technical decision-making that impacts teams beyond your own?
- How do you identify and drive key performance indicators (KPIs) for frontend projects at scale, especially those impacting the international travel user experience?
- Describe a situation where you had to balance stakeholder needs, technical debt, and feature delivery‚Äîhow did you communicate and make decisions across teams?
