# A/B Testing and Experimentation in Frontend Development at Scale

## Question
How do you approach A/B testing and experimentation in frontend development, especially when running hundreds of experiments simultaneously as Agoda does?

## Introduction
Running hundreds of A/B tests simultaneously while maintaining performance, user experience, and statistical integrity requires sophisticated experimentation infrastructure and methodologies. This document outlines advanced A/B testing strategies suitable for large-scale platforms like Agoda, incorporating modern frontend patterns and statistical rigor.

## 1. Experimentation Architecture for Scale

### 1.1 Multi-Layer Experimentation Framework

**Core Components:**
• **Experiment Configuration Management**
  - Centralized experiment definitions with unique IDs and metadata
  - Status tracking (draft, running, paused, completed)
  - Traffic allocation percentages for controlled rollouts
  - Variant definitions with allocation splits and control identification
  - Start/end date management for experiment lifecycle

• **Targeting and Segmentation**
  - Geographic targeting by country/region
  - Device type filtering (mobile, desktop, tablet)
  - User segment targeting (new vs returning users, premium vs free)
  - Custom attribute matching for advanced targeting
  - Mutual exclusion rules to prevent experiment conflicts

• **User Assignment System**
  - Hash-based consistent assignment using user ID + experiment ID
  - Deterministic bucketing ensures users always see same variant
  - Cumulative allocation logic for proper traffic distribution
  - Fallback mechanisms to control variant when assignment fails
  - Assignment persistence across sessions and devices

• **Real-time Configuration Updates**
  - Live experiment configuration changes without deployments
  - WebSocket connections for instant updates
  - Graceful handling of configuration changes mid-experiment
  - Version control for experiment configurations

### 1.2 Conflict Resolution and Priority Management

**Conflict Resolution Strategies:**
• **Priority-Based Resolution**
  - Experiments ranked by business priority scores
  - Higher priority experiments take precedence in conflicts
  - Automatic traffic reallocation when conflicts arise
  - Minimum viable traffic thresholds (typically 10%)

• **Mutual Exclusion Groups**
  - Experiments grouped by feature area or potential interactions
  - Only one experiment per mutex group can run simultaneously
  - Prevents statistical contamination between related tests
  - Automatic conflict detection and resolution

• **Traffic Management**
  - Total traffic allocation cannot exceed 100%
  - Dynamic traffic adjustment when new experiments launch
  - Reserve traffic pools for emergency experiments
  - Gradual traffic ramp-up capabilities

• **Dependency Management**
  - Explicit experiment dependencies and prerequisites
  - Automatic experiment chaining for sequential tests
  - Prerequisite validation before experiment activation

## 2. Frontend Implementation Patterns

### 2.1 Component-Based Experimentation

**React Component Integration:**
• **Experiment Wrapper Components**
  - Declarative experiment components that wrap UI variants
  - Automatic variant resolution based on user assignment
  - Built-in exposure tracking when components render
  - Fallback mechanisms for unassigned users or errors
  - Support for nested experiments within single pages

• **Context-Based State Management**
  - React Context provides experiment data throughout component tree
  - Centralized user assignment and variant resolution
  - Shared experiment state prevents duplicate API calls
  - Real-time updates propagated to all consuming components

• **Practical Implementation Examples**
  - Search results page with grid vs list vs card layouts

  - 15-minute intervals for safe ramp-up progression
  - Automatic rollback on negative metric trends
  - Manual override capabilities for emergency stops

• **Configuration Validation**
  - Pre-deployment validation of experiment configurations
  - Traffic allocation validation (must sum to 100%)
  - Control variant requirement enforcement
  - Statistical power and effect size validation
