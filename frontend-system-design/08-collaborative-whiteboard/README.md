## Core Algorithms

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to Top](#-table-of-contents)

---


### 1. Operational Transform for Drawing Operations

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to Top](#-table-of-contents)

---


**Drawing Operation Types**:
```
DrawOperation = {
  type: 'create' | 'modify' | 'delete' | 'move',
  objectId: string,
  data: ShapeData,
  timestamp: number,
  userId: string
}
```

**Transform Algorithm**:
```
For concurrent operations A and B:
1. Check operation dependencies
2. Transform spatial coordinates
3. Handle object lifecycle conflicts
4. Preserve drawing intent
5. Maintain visual consistency
```

**Conflict Resolution Strategies**:
- **Create-Create**: Generate unique IDs, allow both
- **Modify-Modify**: Merge properties, last-writer-wins for conflicts
- **Delete-Modify**: Delete takes precedence
- **Move-Move**: Apply vector addition for position

### 2. Vector Path Smoothing Algorithm

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to Top](#-table-of-contents)

---


**Ramer-Douglas-Peucker Simplification**:
```
function simplifyPath(points, tolerance):
  if points.length <= 2:
    return points
  
  maxDistance = 0
  maxIndex = 0
  
  for i in range(1, points.length - 1):
    distance = perpendicularDistance(points[i], line(points[0], points[-1]))
    if distance > maxDistance:
      maxDistance = distance
      maxIndex = i
  
  if maxDistance > tolerance:
    left = simplifyPath(points[0:maxIndex+1], tolerance)
    right = simplifyPath(points[maxIndex:], tolerance)
    return left[:-1] + right
  else:
    return [points[0], points[-1]]
```

**Bezier Curve Fitting**:
- Calculate control points using least squares
- Maintain C1 continuity between segments
- Optimize for minimal point count
- Preserve original drawing intention

### 3. Spatial Indexing for Hit Testing

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to Top](#-table-of-contents)

---


**R-Tree Implementation**:
```
RTreeNode = {
  bounds: Rectangle,
  children: RTreeNode[] | Shape[],
  isLeaf: boolean
}
```

**Hit Testing Algorithm**:
1. Traverse R-tree from root
2. Check bounding box intersections
3. Perform precise hit testing on leaf shapes
4. Return shapes in depth order
5. Handle overlapping objects

**Insertion Strategy**:
- Choose leaf with minimal area enlargement
- Split nodes when capacity exceeded
- Rebalance tree periodically
- Update bounds propagation

### 4. Multi-layer Rendering System

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to Top](#-table-of-contents)

---


**Layer Management**:
```
Layer = {
  id: string,
  zIndex: number,
  visible: boolean,
  locked: boolean,
  opacity: number,
  shapes: Shape[]
}
```

**Composite Rendering Process**:
1. Sort layers by z-index
2. Render each layer to separate canvas
3. Apply layer-specific effects (opacity, blend modes)
4. Composite layers using GPU acceleration
5. Handle layer visibility changes efficiently

### 5. Pressure-Sensitive Drawing Algorithm

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to Top](#-table-of-contents)

---


**Pressure Interpolation**:
```
function interpolatePressure(points):
  for i in range(1, points.length):
    startPressure = points[i-1].pressure
    endPressure = points[i].pressure
    distance = calculateDistance(points[i-1], points[i])
    segments = Math.max(1, Math.floor(distance / 2))
    
    for j in range(segments):
      t = j / segments
      pressure = lerp(startPressure, endPressure, t)
      interpolatedPoints.push({
        x: lerp(points[i-1].x, points[i].x, t),
        y: lerp(points[i-1].y, points[i].y, t),
        pressure: pressure
      })
```

**Brush Dynamics**:
- Map pressure to stroke width
- Adjust opacity based on velocity
- Implement tilt sensitivity for stylus
- Apply texture mapping for natural brush effects
