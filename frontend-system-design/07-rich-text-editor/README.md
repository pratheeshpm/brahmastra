## Core Algorithms

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to Top](#-table-of-contents)

---


### 1. Operational Transform (OT) for Text Editing

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to Top](#-table-of-contents)

---


**Algorithm Purpose**: Ensures consistency when multiple users edit simultaneously.

**Key Components**:
- **Transform Function**: Adjusts operations based on concurrent changes
- **State Vector**: Tracks document version for each client
- **Operation Composition**: Combines multiple operations efficiently

**Transform Logic**:
```
For operations O1 and O2 occurring concurrently:
1. Calculate position offsets based on operation order
2. Adjust ranges for insertions/deletions
3. Merge formatting operations
4. Maintain intent preservation
```

**Conflict Resolution Strategy**:
- Insert operations: Bias towards earlier timestamp
- Delete operations: Check if range still exists
- Format operations: Last-writer-wins with merge

### 2. Selection Synchronization Algorithm

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to Top](#-table-of-contents)

---


**Multi-user Selection Tracking**:
```
Selection State = {
  userId: string,
  ranges: [{ start: position, end: position }],
  timestamp: number,
  cursor: position
}
```

**Selection Transform Process**:
1. Convert DOM selection to document model position
2. Apply operational transforms to maintain accuracy
3. Broadcast selection changes to peers
4. Render peer selections with user colors

### 3. Undo/Redo Stack Management

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to Top](#-table-of-contents)

---


**Command Pattern Implementation**:
```
Command = {
  execute(): void,
  undo(): void,
  redo(): void,
  merge(other: Command): boolean
}
```

**Stack Management Logic**:
- Group rapid operations (typing) into single commands
- Maintain separate stacks for each user in collaborative mode
- Implement command merging for efficiency
- Handle conflicts with peer operations

### 4. Comment Anchoring Algorithm

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to Top](#-table-of-contents)

---


**Text Anchor Strategy**:
```
Anchor = {
  startOffset: number,
  endOffset: number,
  contextBefore: string,
  contextAfter: string,
  nodeId: string
}
```

**Anchor Maintenance Process**:
1. Store relative positions within text nodes
2. Maintain context strings for fuzzy matching
3. Update anchors when text operations occur
4. Handle orphaned comments gracefully

### 5. AI Suggestion Ranking Algorithm

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to Top](#-table-of-contents)

---


**Ranking Factors**:
- Grammar importance score (0-1)
- Style consistency impact (0-1)
- User acceptance history (0-1)
- Context relevance (0-1)

**Ranking Formula**:
```
Score = (0.4 √ó Grammar) + (0.3 √ó Style) + (0.2 √ó History) + (0.1 √ó Context)
```

**Learning Component**:
- Track user acceptance/rejection patterns
- Adjust suggestion confidence scores
- Personalize suggestions based on writing style

## Performance Optimizations

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to Top](#-table-of-contents)

---


### Virtual Rendering for Large Documents

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to Top](#-table-of-contents)

---


**Viewport-based Rendering**:
- Render only visible blocks plus buffer
- Implement incremental DOM updates
- Use document fragments for efficient insertion
- Maintain block-level virtualization

**Memory Management**:
- Lazy load historical operations
- Compress old document states
- Implement LRU cache for rendered blocks
- Garbage collect unused command objects

### Debouncing and Batching

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to Top](#-table-of-contents)

---


**Operation Batching Strategy**:
```
Batch Window = 50ms
Max Batch Size = 10 operations
Batch Types: [typing, formatting, selection]
```

**Network Optimization**:
- Compress operations using binary encoding
- Implement delta compression for large changes
- Use connection pooling for multiple documents
- Implement smart reconnection with exponential backoff

## Trade-offs and Considerations

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to Top](#-table-of-contents)

---


### Performance vs Features

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to Top](#-table-of-contents)

---

- **Rich formatting**: Complex DOM structure impacts performance
- **Real-time sync**: Network overhead vs user experience
- **AI suggestions**: Processing time vs suggestion quality
- **Large documents**: Memory usage vs responsiveness

### Consistency vs Availability

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to Top](#-table-of-contents)

---

- **Strong consistency**: Ensures data integrity but may impact availability
- **Eventual consistency**: Better performance but potential conflicts
- **Hybrid approach**: Critical operations strongly consistent, others eventual

### Scalability Considerations

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to Top](#-table-of-contents)

---

- **Document size limits**: Prevent memory exhaustion
- **Concurrent user limits**: Maintain performance standards
- **Operation rate limiting**: Prevent abuse and ensure stability
- **Storage optimization**: Balance between features and cost

This rich text editor system provides a comprehensive foundation for collaborative document editing with advanced features like real-time synchronization, AI-powered suggestions, and robust comment systems while maintaining performance and accessibility standards.
