    "explanation": "## Algorithm Explanation\n\n• **Approach**: Use a sliding window technique with a hash map to track the last seen index of each character.\n• **Key Insight**: By maintaining the start of the current substring and updating it when a duplicate character is found, we can efficiently find the longest substring without repeating characters.\n• **Steps**:\n  1. Initialize a map to store the last index of each character.\n  2. Iterate over the string, updating the start of the substring when a duplicate is found.\n  3. Calculate the length of the current substring and update the maximum length found.\n\n### Dry Run Example\n\n**Input**: \"abcabcbb\"\n**Process**:\n- Step 1: Initialize start = 0, maxLength = 0, charIndexMap = {}\n- Step 2: Iterate over 'a', update map, maxLength = 1\n- Step 3: Iterate over 'b', update map, maxLength = 2\n- Step 4: Iterate over 'c', update map, maxLength = 3\n- Step 5: 'a' found again, update start to 1, continue\n- Step 6: Continue updating map and maxLength as needed\n**Output**: 3",
    "complexity_analysis": "**Time Complexity**: O(n) - We traverse the string once, and each character is processed at most twice (once when added and once when the start is moved).\n**Space Complexity**: O(min(n, m)) - where n is the length of the string and m is the size of the character set, due to the hash map storing characters.",
    "brute_force_approach": "The brute force approach involves checking all possible substrings and verifying if they contain all unique characters. This would involve two nested loops, resulting in a time complexity of O(n^2). For each substring, we would need to check if all characters are unique, which can be done in O(n) time using a set, leading to an overall complexity of O(n^3).",
