    "explanation": "## Algorithm Explanation\n\n• **Approach**: Use a sliding window technique with a hash map to track the last seen index of each character.\n• **Key Insight**: By keeping track of the last index of each character, we can efficiently move the start of the window to avoid duplicates.\n• **Steps**:\n  1. Initialize a map to store the last index of each character and variables for max length and start index.\n  2. Iterate over the string, updating the start index if a duplicate character is found within the current window.\n  3. Update the maximum length of the substring as we iterate.\n\n### Dry Run Example\n\n**Input**: \"abcabcbb\"\n**Process**:\n- Step 1: Initialize map, maxLength = 0, start = 0\n- Step 2: Iterate over 'a', map = {a: 0}, maxLength = 1\n- Step 3: Iterate over 'b', map = {a: 0, b: 1}, maxLength = 2\n- Step 4: Iterate over 'c', map = {a: 0, b: 1, c: 2}, maxLength = 3\n- Step 5: Iterate over 'a', start = 1, map = {a: 3, b: 1, c: 2}, maxLength = 3\n- Continue similarly for remaining characters\n**Output**: 3",
    "complexity_analysis": "**Time Complexity**: O(n) - We traverse the string once, and each character is processed at most twice (once when added to the map and once when the start is updated).\n**Space Complexity**: O(min(n, m)) - where n is the length of the string and m is the size of the character set, due to the hash map storing character indices.",
    "brute_force_approach": "A brute force approach would involve checking all possible substrings and verifying if they contain duplicate characters. This would involve two nested loops, resulting in a time complexity of O(n^2). The space complexity would be O(min(n, m)) for storing unique characters in a set.",
