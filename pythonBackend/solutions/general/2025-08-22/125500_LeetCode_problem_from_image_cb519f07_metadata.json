    "explanation": "## Algorithm Explanation\n\n• **Approach**: Use a sliding window technique with a hash map to track the last seen index of each character.\n• **Key Insight**: By keeping track of the last seen index of characters, we can efficiently skip over duplicates and adjust the window size.\n• **Steps**:\n  1. Initialize a map to store the last index of each character and variables for max length and start of the window.\n  2. Iterate over the string, checking if the character is in the map and within the current window.\n  3. Adjust the start of the window if a duplicate is found, update the map, and calculate the max length.\n\n### Dry Run Example\n\n**Input**: \"abcabcbb\"\n**Process**:\n- Step 1: Initialize map, maxLength = 0, start = 0\n- Step 2: Iterate over 'a', 'b', 'c', update map and maxLength\n- Step 3: Encounter 'a' again, adjust start, continue updating map and maxLength\n**Output**: 3",
    "complexity_analysis": "**Time Complexity**: O(n) - We traverse the string once, and each character is processed at most twice (once added and once removed from the map).\n**Space Complexity**: O(min(n, m)) - where n is the length of the string and m is the size of the character set, due to the map storing characters.",
    "brute_force_approach": "A brute force approach would involve checking all possible substrings and verifying if they contain duplicate characters. This would result in a time complexity of O(n^3) due to the nested loops for generating substrings and checking for duplicates.",
