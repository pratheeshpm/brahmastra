    "explanation": "## Algorithm Explanation\n\n• **Approach**: Use two separate lists to partition nodes based on their values relative to x.\n• **Key Insight**: Maintain two pointers to build two lists and then connect them.\n• **Steps**:\n  1. Initialize two dummy nodes to start the 'less' and 'greater' lists.\n  2. Traverse the original list, appending nodes to the appropriate list based on their value.\n  3. Connect the 'less' list to the 'greater' list and return the head of the new list.\n\n### Dry Run Example\n\n**Input**: head = [1,4,3,2,5,2], x = 3\n**Process**:\n- Step 1: Initialize lessHead and greaterHead as dummy nodes.\n- Step 2: Traverse the list, adding 1, 2, 2 to 'less' and 4, 3, 5 to 'greater'.\n- Step 3: Connect 'less' list to 'greater' list.\n**Output**: [1,2,2,4,3,5]",
    "complexity_analysis": "**Time Complexity**: O(n) - We traverse the list once, where n is the number of nodes.\n**Space Complexity**: O(1) - We use a constant amount of extra space for pointers.",
    "brute_force_approach": "A brute force approach would involve creating a new list and iterating over the original list twice: once to add nodes less than x and once to add nodes greater than or equal to x. This approach would also have a time complexity of O(n) but would require additional space for a new list, making it less space-efficient.",
