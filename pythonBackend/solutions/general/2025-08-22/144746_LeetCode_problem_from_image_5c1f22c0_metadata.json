    "explanation": "## Algorithm Explanation\n\n• **Approach**: Use a sliding window technique with a hash map to track the last seen index of each character.\n• **Key Insight**: By keeping track of the last seen index of each character, we can efficiently move the start of the window to avoid duplicates.\n• **Steps**:\n  1. Initialize a map to store the last index of each character.\n  2. Use two pointers: one for the start of the current substring and one for the current character.\n  3. Iterate through the string, updating the start pointer and max length as needed.\n\n### Dry Run Example\n\n**Input**: \"abcabcbb\"\n**Process**:\n- Step 1: Start with an empty map, maxLength = 0, start = 0.\n- Step 2: Iterate over 'a', update map, maxLength = 1.\n- Step 3: Iterate over 'b', update map, maxLength = 2.\n- Step 4: Iterate over 'c', update map, maxLength = 3.\n- Step 5: 'a' is repeated, move start to 1, update map.\n- Continue until end of string.\n**Output**: 3",
    "complexity_analysis": "**Time Complexity**: O(n) - We traverse the string once, and each character is processed at most twice (once when added and once when the start is moved).\n**Space Complexity**: O(min(n, m)) - where n is the length of the string and m is the size of the character set, due to the hash map storing characters.",
    "brute_force_approach": "A brute force approach would involve checking all possible substrings and verifying if they contain duplicate characters. This would have a time complexity of O(n^3) because generating all substrings takes O(n^2) and checking each substring for duplicates takes O(n).",
