    "explanation": "## Algorithm Explanation\n\n• **Approach**: Traverse the sorted array while tracking the previous number to identify gaps.\n• **Key Insight**: Use the current and previous numbers to detect missing ranges efficiently.\n• **Steps**:\n  1. Initialize the previous number as one less than the lower bound.\n  2. Iterate through the array, checking for gaps between the previous and current numbers.\n  3. Add missing ranges to the result list and update the previous number.\n\n### Dry Run Example\n\n**Input**: nums = [0, 1, 3, 50, 75], lower = 0, upper = 99\n**Process**:\n- Step 1: Start with prev = -1\n- Step 2: Iterate over nums and check gaps\n  - Between -1 and 0: no gap\n  - Between 1 and 3: add '2'\n  - Between 3 and 50: add '4->49'\n  - Between 50 and 75: add '51->74'\n  - Between 75 and 99: add '76->99'\n**Output**: ['2', '4->49', '51->74', '76->99']",
    "complexity_analysis": "**Time Complexity**: O(n) - We iterate through the array once, making the time complexity linear with respect to the number of elements.\n**Space Complexity**: O(1) - We use a constant amount of extra space for variables, not counting the output list.",
    "brute_force_approach": "A brute force approach would involve checking each number in the range [lower, upper] to see if it is missing from the array. This would have a time complexity of O(m), where m is the size of the range, and a space complexity of O(1).",
