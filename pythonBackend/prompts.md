First check for any unfinished job that if failed in last task, if complete proceed with these: 


 1. i want solution manager to be used by all other question solver types like leetcode/js/react so on. n it shud organise n keep the files too based on the question category. 2. Create another endpoint n feature that scrapes the web for the question asked (could be anything like system design interview question) and creates a very comprehensive doc with mermaid diagram code with clear explanations in it in detail. For this task, check if openai exposes any tools or apis to scrape the web (check @Web for the same ) or use the openrouter sonar perplexity model for scraping(Openrouter key is in env variable)
