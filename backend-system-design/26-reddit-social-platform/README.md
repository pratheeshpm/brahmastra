## Trade-offs and Considerations

### Consistency vs Performance

**Consistency Requirements:**
- Strong consistency needed for user authentication and ownership
- Vote counts can tolerate eventual consistency for performance
- Feed updates acceptable with slight delays for better throughput
- Financial data (awards, premium features) requires strong consistency

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Read replicas sacrifice consistency for read performance
- Caching introduces staleness but improves response times
- Asynchronous processing improves user experience but delays consistency
- Geographic distribution creates consistency challenges

**Balanced Approach:**
- Use strong consistency for critical operations
- Accept eventual consistency for non-critical data
- Implement conflict resolution for distributed operations
- Provide clear expectations to users about data freshness

### Real-time vs Batch Processing

**Real-time Processing Benefits:**
- Immediate vote count updates improve user engagement
- Real-time spam detection prevents bad content spread
- Live feed updates provide fresh content discovery
- Instant notifications enhance user experience

**Batch Processing Advantages:**
- Higher throughput for vote aggregation and analytics
- More efficient resource utilization for bulk operations
- Better cost optimization through resource sharing
- Easier implementation of complex ranking algorithms

**Hybrid Implementation:**
- Real-time processing for user-facing operations
- Batch processing for analytics and complex computations
- Mixed approach for vote counting (real-time display, batch aggregation)
- Event-driven architecture to bridge real-time and batch systems

### Storage vs Compute Trade-offs

**Storage Optimization:**
- Compress old content to reduce storage costs
- Archive inactive content to cheaper storage tiers
- Use CDN for media to distribute storage costs
- Implement data lifecycle policies for cost management

**Compute Optimization:**
- Cache frequently accessed data to reduce computation
- Pre-compute popular feeds and rankings
- Use efficient algorithms for ranking and recommendations
- Optimize database queries to reduce CPU usage

**Technology Selection:**
- **Database**: DynamoDB for scalability vs PostgreSQL for consistency
- **Caching**: Redis for performance vs cost of memory
- **Storage**: S3 for durability vs local storage for speed
- **Compute**: Auto-scaling for cost vs reserved instances for performance
- **CDN**: Global CDN for performance vs regional CDN for cost
