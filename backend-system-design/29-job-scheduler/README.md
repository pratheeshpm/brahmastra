## Trade-offs and Considerations

### Consistency vs Availability

**Strong Consistency Requirements:**
- Job state transitions must be atomic and consistent
- Worker assignments require immediate consistency
- Job dependency chains need ordered execution guarantees
- Financial and critical system jobs require ACID compliance

**High Availability Optimization:**
- Job status queries can tolerate eventual consistency
- Metrics and monitoring data can be eventually consistent
- Worker health data can have slight delays
- Historical reporting can accept data staleness

**Balanced Approach:**
- Use strong consistency for critical job operations
- Accept eventual consistency for monitoring and metrics
- Implement read replicas for improved availability
- Provide clear SLA expectations for different operations

### Resource Efficiency vs Redundancy

**Resource Efficiency Focus:**
- Maximize worker utilization through intelligent scheduling
- Use resource sharing and multiplexing for cost optimization
- Implement just-in-time resource allocation
- Optimize for minimal resource waste and overhead

**Redundancy and Reliability:**
- Maintain resource buffers for handling demand spikes
- Implement multi-region redundancy for disaster recovery
- Keep spare worker capacity for immediate failover
- Maintain multiple replicas of critical system components

**Optimization Strategy:**
- Balance utilization targets with reliability requirements
- Use predictive scaling to minimize resource waste
- Implement tiered service levels with different redundancy
- Monitor cost vs. reliability metrics for optimization
