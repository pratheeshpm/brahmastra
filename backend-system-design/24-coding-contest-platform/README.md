## Trade-offs and Considerations

### Real-time vs Batch Evaluation

**Real-time Benefits:**
- Immediate feedback for participants during contests
- Better user experience with instant submission results
- Real-time leaderboard updates for competitive engagement
- Quick identification and resolution of technical issues

**Batch Processing Advantages:**
- Higher throughput for large submission volumes
- More efficient resource utilization through batching
- Easier implementation of complex evaluation pipelines
- Better cost optimization through resource sharing

**Hybrid Approach:**
- Real-time evaluation for contest submissions
- Batch processing for practice submissions and analysis
- Priority queues for different submission types
- Dynamic switching based on system load

### Accuracy vs Speed

**Accuracy Requirements:**
- Precise timing measurement for competitive programming
- Comprehensive test case coverage for correctness
- Detailed error reporting for educational value
- Consistent evaluation across all submissions

**Speed Optimization:**
- Fast feedback for better user experience
- High throughput to handle submission spikes
- Minimal latency for contest operations
- Efficient resource utilization

**Balance Strategies:**
- Parallel test case execution when possible
- Progressive feedback (quick basic tests, then comprehensive)
- Cached results for identical submissions
- Approximate timing for non-critical operations

### Cost vs Performance

**Performance Investment:**
- High-performance compute instances for code execution
- Premium storage for fast data access
- Global CDN for low-latency content delivery
- Redundant infrastructure for high availability

**Cost Optimization:**
- Auto-scaling to match demand
- Spot instances for non-critical workloads
- Efficient resource scheduling and sharing
- Data archival strategies for old contest data

**Technology Selection:**
- **Compute**: EC2 M5.2xlarge instances for balanced performance
- **Storage**: S3 for submissions with intelligent tiering
- **Database**: Cassandra for high-volume data, PostgreSQL for transactional
- **Cache**: Redis cluster for distributed caching
- **Queue**: SQS for reliable message processing with Kafka for high-throughput
