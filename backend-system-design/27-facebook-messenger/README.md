## Trade-offs and Considerations

### Protocol Selection Trade-offs

**WebSocket vs Short Polling:**
- **WebSocket Advantages**: Real-time delivery, lower latency, reduced server load
- **Short Polling Advantages**: Simpler implementation, stateless, easier debugging
- **WebSocket Challenges**: Connection management, server resources, complexity
- **Short Polling Challenges**: Higher latency, unnecessary requests, battery drain

**WebSocket vs Long Polling:**
- **WebSocket Benefits**: True bidirectional communication, lower overhead
- **Long Polling Benefits**: Simpler than WebSocket, better than short polling
- **Implementation Complexity**: WebSocket requires more sophisticated infrastructure
- **Resource Usage**: WebSocket uses persistent connections, long polling uses held requests

**Hybrid Approach:**
- Use WebSocket for active users requiring real-time communication
- Fall back to push notifications for offline or background users
- Implement graceful degradation from WebSocket to polling when needed
- Optimize each protocol for its specific use case

### Consistency vs Latency

**Message Ordering Trade-offs:**
- **Strong Consistency**: Guarantees correct ordering but increases latency
- **Eventual Consistency**: Lower latency but possible temporary inconsistencies
- **Causal Consistency**: Balance between ordering guarantees and performance
- **Session Consistency**: Consistency within user sessions with global eventual consistency

**Delivery Guarantees:**
- **At-Most-Once**: Fast delivery but possible message loss
- **At-Least-Once**: Guaranteed delivery but possible duplicates
- **Exactly-Once**: Perfect delivery but complex implementation and higher latency
- **Best Effort**: Optimized for performance with acceptable reliability

**Practical Implementation:**
- Use strong consistency for critical operations (authentication, payments)
- Accept eventual consistency for non-critical features (read receipts, online status)
- Implement conflict resolution for concurrent operations
- Provide user feedback about system state and potential delays

### Storage vs Memory Trade-offs

**Message Storage Strategy:**
- **Hot Data**: Recent messages in fast storage (SSD, memory)
- **Warm Data**: Older messages in standard storage
- **Cold Data**: Archive old messages in cheap storage
- **Caching**: Balance memory usage with query performance

**Connection State Management:**
- **In-Memory State**: Fast access but limited by server memory
- **Persistent State**: Survives server restarts but slower access
- **Hybrid Approach**: Critical state in memory with persistent backup
- **Distributed State**: Share state across multiple servers

**Technology Selection:**
- **Database Choice**: Cassandra for messages, Redis for real-time state
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-level caching for optimal performance
- **Storage Tiers**: Automatic migration based on data age and access patterns
- **Compression**: Balance storage savings with processing overhead
