- Dynamic frequency adjustment based on price volatility

**Resource Optimization:**
- Cloud auto-scaling for cost-effective resource management
- Intelligent batching to maximize scraping efficiency
- Geographic distribution for reduced latency and costs
- Caching strategies to minimize redundant processing

**Business Impact:**
- Competitive advantage through faster price drop detection
- User retention and engagement benefits
- Revenue impact of notification delivery timing
- Operational cost management for sustainable growth

### Real-time vs Batch Notifications

**Real-time Benefits:**
- Immediate price drop alerts for time-sensitive deals
- Enhanced user experience and engagement
- Competitive advantage in fast-moving markets
- Higher conversion rates for price-sensitive users

**Batch Processing Advantages:**
- Reduced notification fatigue through aggregation
- Cost savings on notification delivery
- Better resource utilization and system performance
- Improved content quality through aggregation

**Hybrid Approach:**
- Real-time alerts for significant price drops
- Batch processing for regular updates and minor changes
- User preference-based notification timing
- Intelligent threshold-based real-time triggering

### SQL vs NoSQL for Price Data

**SQL Database Benefits:**
- ACID transactions for data consistency
- Complex query capabilities for analytics
- Mature ecosystem and tooling
- Strong consistency guarantees

**NoSQL Advantages:**
- Horizontal scaling for large datasets
- Flexible schema for diverse product data
- High write throughput for price updates
- Better performance for simple lookup queries

**Hybrid Architecture:**
- SQL for transactional user and subscription data
- NoSQL for high-volume price history and analytics
- Cache layer for frequently accessed data
- Data synchronization between storage systems

**Technology Selection:**
- PostgreSQL for transactional data and complex analytics
- Cassandra or DynamoDB for time-series price data
- Redis for caching and session management
- Elasticsearch for full-text search and analytics
