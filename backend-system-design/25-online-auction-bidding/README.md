## Trade-offs and Considerations

### Real-time vs Batch Processing

**Real-time Processing Benefits:**
- Immediate bid validation and feedback for users
- Live auction updates create competitive bidding atmosphere
- Instant fraud detection and prevention
- Real-time market pricing and discovery

**Batch Processing Advantages:**
- Higher throughput for non-time-sensitive operations
- More efficient resource utilization for analytics
- Easier implementation of complex business logic
- Better cost optimization through resource sharing

**Hybrid Implementation:**
- Real-time processing for bid validation and WebSocket updates
- Batch processing for auction closure and winner determination
- OLAP systems for analytics and reporting with Spark jobs
- Event-driven triggers for time-sensitive operations

### Consistency vs Availability

**Strong Consistency Requirements:**
- Bid ordering and sequence validation must be linearizable
- Payment transactions require ACID compliance
- Winner determination needs consistent bid history
- Financial data must maintain strict consistency

**Eventual Consistency Acceptance:**
- View counts and engagement metrics can be eventually consistent
- User activity logs and analytics data
- Non-critical notifications and user preferences
- Search indexes and recommendation data

**CAP Theorem Implementation:**
- Partition tolerance prioritized for global availability
- Consistency preferred for financial and bidding operations
- Availability optimized for read-heavy operations
- Geographic partitioning with regional consistency
